## Machine Learning: École Polytechnique Master's Course

### Course Overview
This repository contains the code and notebooks for the labs from a Machine Learning master's course at École Polytechnique. The course, taught by Professor Alain Durmus, covers various machine learning techniques and their applications.

### Lab Topics
The labs focus on foundational machine learning algorithms and provide hands-on experience with their implementation and optimization. The following labs are included:

- Lab 1: Linear Regression - Introduction to linear modeling and prediction.
- Lab 2: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - Implementing the KNN algorithm for classification tasks.
- Lab 3: Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent (GD & SGD) - Exploring optimization techniques used in training machine learning models.
- Lab 4: Bayesian Linear Regression - Integrating Bayesian approaches with linear regression models.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Primary programming language used for all labs.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing data.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
